# gess

A _ge_nerator for _s_ynthetic _s_treams of financial transactions.

## Usage

First, start `gess` like so:

    $ ./gess.sh start 
  
Then, check if `gess` is working fine:

    $ ./dummy_gess_sink.sh

## To Do

* Provide stats (fintrans per second, overall count, kB/s)
* Implement throttling
* Implement multi-gess (launch X instances of gess-main in range of ports) 

## Architecture
TBD.
